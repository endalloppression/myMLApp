# myMLApp
This is a Data classification application that uses a simple linear regression to determine a binary yes or no (1 or 0 values) for lexicographical sentiment from feedback survey for trivial test data.
It trains the model over a period of 60 seconds with a 10% subset of the training data. It's a console application that will tell you the most positive sentiment feedback.
